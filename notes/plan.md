# Plan

## Releases

* [ ] stats of cases: versions, exact title matches; common prefixes (e.g. "XYZ Report 20XX", ...)

## Containers

* [ ] create notebook on duplicates
* [ ] static mapping, that is efficient to store, maybe via: https://github.com/pytries/marisa-trie

If matching only by name, we need to lookup a (exact) name.

* need a mapping from "name" and "name variants" to journal "issnl"

## Bulk

* [ ] download export

## Performance

* provide some fast path
