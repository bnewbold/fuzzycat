# Extra code and docs

Rough notes on applications.

## Reproducibility

Projects end up with a data folder, that is hard to reproduce.

What you need to know:

* commands invoked
* their order and dependencies

We want to run N cluster algorithms and maybe for each of them run M
verification algorithms, so in the end, we can evaluate approaches against well
specified examples (test cases).
