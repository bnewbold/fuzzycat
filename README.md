# fuzzycat (wip)

Fuzzy matching publications for [fatcat](https://fatcat.wiki).

* [fuzzycat](https://pypi.org/project/fuzzycat/)

## Motivation

Most of the results on sites like [Google
Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=fuzzy+matching) group
publications into clusters. Each cluster represents one publication, abstracted
from its concrete representation as a link to a PDF.

We call the abstract publication *work* and the concrete instance a *release*.
The goal is to group releases under works and to implement a versions feature.

This repository contains both generic code for matching as well as fatcat
specific code using the fatcat openapi client.

## Datasets

* release and container metadata from: [https://archive.org/details/fatcat_bulk_exports_2020-08-05](https://archive.org/details/fatcat_bulk_exports_2020-08-05).
* issn journal level data, via [issnlister](https://github.com/miku/issnlister)
* abbreviation lists

## Performance data point

Candidate generation via elasticsearch, 40 parallel queries, sustained speed at
about 17857 queries per hour, that is around 5 queries/s.

```
$ time cat ~/data/researchgate/x04 | \
    parallel -j40 --pipe -N 1 ./fatcatx_rg_unmatched.py - \
    > ~/data/researchgate/x04_results.ndj

## Data issues

### A republised article

* [https://fatcat.wiki/release/search?q=%22The+doctor+with+seven+billion+patients%22](https://fatcat.wiki/release/search?q=%22The+doctor+with+seven+billion+patients%22)

There is "student BMJ" and "BMJ" - this (html) article (interview) has been
first published on "sbmj" (Published 07 July 2011), then "bmj" (Published 10
August 2011).

> Notes; Originally published as: Student BMJ 2011;19:d3983

* https://www.bmj.com/content/343/sbmj.d3983
* https://www.bmj.com/content/343/bmj.d4964

It is essentially the same text, same title, author, just different DOI and
probably a different recorded date.

Generic pattern "republication" duplicate:

* metadata mostly same, except date and doi

### Common title

Probably a few thousand very common short titles.

* [https://fatcat.wiki/release/search?q=%22Book+Reviews%22](https://fatcat.wiki/release/search?q=%22Book+Reviews%22) (238852)

Some authors do this regularly:

* [https://fatcat.wiki/release/search?q=%22Book+Reviews%22+%22william%22+%22michael%22](https://fatcat.wiki/release/search?q=%22Book+Reviews%22+%22william%22+%22michael%22) (398)

Different DOI, so we know it is different.

More examples:

* [https://fatcat.wiki/release/search?q=%22errata%22](https://fatcat.wiki/release/search?q=%22errata%22) (37680)
* [https://fatcat.wiki/release/search?q=%22Einleitung%22](https://fatcat.wiki/release/search?q=%22Einleitung%22) (68005)

### Title with extra data

* like ISBN, ISSN, price and all kind of extra metadata
* [https://fatcat.wiki/release/search?q=title%3A%22ISBN%22](https://fatcat.wiki/release/search?q=title%3A%22ISBN%22)
* titles typically get longer: [https://fatcat.wiki/release/olxswrilxfci3ibb3bg5xhstr4](https://fatcat.wiki/release/olxswrilxfci3ibb3bg5xhstr4)
* some of these are actually "reviews", e.g. [https://fatcat.wiki/release/4blc5mfc5bfaxkofuletqxuzp4](https://fatcat.wiki/release/4blc5mfc5bfaxkofuletqxuzp4)

Another example:

* too [long](https://fatcat.wiki/release/hewmq4afvnew7pwttvulzguubu), original suggested citation seems to be:

> Parker, S. and Kerrod, R. (2002), "Childrenâ€™s) Space Busters (1st) Looking at Stars (2nd)", Reference Reviews, Vol. 16 No. 5, pp. 26-27. https://doi.org/10.1108/rr.2002.16.5.26.252

### Sometimes a title will be ambiguous

For example given a title "Shakespeare in Tokyo" we would have to always return "ambiguous", as there are at least two separate publication with that name:

* [https://fatcat.wiki/release/search?q=%22Shakespeare+in+Tokyo%22](https://fatcat.wiki/release/search?q=%22Shakespeare+in+Tokyo%22)

This is similar to journal names, where some journal names will always be ambiguous.

### Versions

* same title, same authors, "vX" doi
* [https://fatcat.wiki/release/search?q=%22Self-similarity+analysis+of+the+non-linear%22](https://fatcat.wiki/release/search?q=%22Self-similarity+analysis+of+the+non-linear%22)

Sometimes, we have a couple of preprint versions, plus a published version (with a slightly different title):

* [https://fatcat.wiki/release/search?q=%22Time-periodic+solutions+of+massive%22](https://fatcat.wiki/release/search?q=%22Time-periodic+solutions+of+massive%22)
